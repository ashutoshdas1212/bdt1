Step 1: Create a new project directory and navigate to it in your terminal.

Step 2: Create the project structure by creating the necessary directories. Run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
mkdir -p src/main/scala
mkdir -p src/main/resources
Step 3: Create the Scala source file. Use a text editor to create a new file called tweetmining.scala inside the src/main/scala directory. Copy and paste your Spark program code into this file.

Step 4: Create a resource file. Use a text editor to create a new file called tweet.sbt inside the src/main/resources directory. Copy and paste the following contents into this file:

scala
Copy code
libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.play" %% "play-json" % "2.9.2"
This will include the rt.json library as a dependency.

Step 5: Build the project. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
sbt package
This command will compile your code and package it into a JAR file.

Step 6: Run the Spark job. After successfully building the project, you can run the Spark job using the spark-submit command. Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
spark-submit --class tweetmining --master local[*] target/scala-2.12/tweetmining_2.12-1.0.jar path_to_json_file
Replace path_to_json_file with the actual path to your JSON file containing the tweets.

Make sure you have Spark installed and configured properly on your machine before running the spark-submit command. Also, ensure that the sbt command is available in your system's PATH.

That's it! The Spark program will be compiled, packaged, and executed using the specified JSON file as input. The results will be printed to the console.
